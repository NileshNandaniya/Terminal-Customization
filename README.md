# Terminal-Customization
How to customize terminal in bash shell (without installing another shell like zsh)

    > Open terminal Enter the command : ls -la
    > If you can't see any file name . bashrc than create one using command: touch .bashrc
    > Copy the code from this repository file .bash_profile and enter the code at the end of .bashrc file
    > Now Enter the command : source .bashrc  or restart your termianl

Your terminal is already customize but still you want to make changes like you want to show git repository and wanted to show which branch you are working on
So for that you have to grab the code from the another repository dotfiles i am giving the link below
